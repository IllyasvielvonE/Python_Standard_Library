    The textwrap module can be used to format text for output in
    situations where pretty-printing is desired.  It offers
    programmatic functionality similar to the paragraph wrapping
    or filling features found in many text editors.

    If you talk several times to Roderika while she is found on Stormhill Shack, you will obtain
Sitting Sideways pose and then she will give you the Spirit Jellyfish Ashes.
    Deliver her message and return with a Chrystalids' Memento found on a pile of corpses within Rampart Tower. 
She will still be at the shack. The next time you meet Roderika will be at the Roundtable Hold. Meet her there to obtain a Golden Seed.
    She can be found later again in Roundtable Hold as a Spirit Tuner where she is not wearing her riding hood anymore, 
provided that you have given her the Chrysalids' Memento and have spoken to Smithing Master Hewg.
